The Mahābhārata is one of India’s most famous texts (we read about it in the theme ‘Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’). Interestingly, it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga (parts of Bengal), Prāgjyotiṣha (roughly today’s Assam), Kaccha (today’s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today’s Kerala), and so on. \\nLET’S EXPLORE\\nDo you recognise the names of any regions given in the map \\n(Fig. 5.4) on page 79? List the ones that you have heard of.\\nBut when do we come across a name for the entire Indian Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to date, this is not an easy question to answer . The Mahābhārata uses the terms ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ and ‘Jambudvīpa’, and scholars generally agree that this long poem was written from a few centuries BCE onward. \\nThe first term, ‘Bhāratavarṣha’, clearly extends to the entire \\nSubcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous rivers and peoples. ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ means ‘the country of the Bharatas’. ‘Bharata’ is a name that first appears in the Ṛig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups of people. In later literature, several kings named ‘Bharata’ are mentioned. \\nThe second term, ‘Jambudvīpa’, means ‘the island of the \\nfruit of the jamun tree’. This is indeed a common tree native to India, also called ‘jambul tree’, ‘Malabar plum tree’, etc. ‘Jambudvīpa’ came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.\\nIn fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor — his \\nname is Aśhoka and we will meet him later; for now, we can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same \\n5-100724-v16.indd   785-100724-v16.indd   78 11-Jul-24   4:25:00 PM11-Jul-24   4:25:00 PM\\n'),\n",

For instance, in an ancient text called the Viṣhṇu Purāṇa, we read:\\nuttaram yat samudrasya himādreścaiva\\ndakṣiṇam varṣam tad bhāratam nāma ...\\n “The country that lies north of the ocean\\nand south of the snowy mountains is \\ncalled Bhārata.”\\nThis name, ‘Bhārata’ remains in use even today. In north India, it is generally written as ‘Bharat’, while in south India, it is often ‘Bharatam’.\\nTHINK ABOUT IT\\nHave you identified the ‘snowy mountains’? Do you think this \\nbrief description of Bhārata is correct?\\nIt is interesting to note that different parts of the country \\nadopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago, praises a king whose name is known “from [Cape] Kumari in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from the oceans on the east and on the west...” You can now recognise ‘the great mountain in the north’, and it should not be difficult to identify ‘Cape Kumari’. It looks like ancient Indians knew their geography well!\\n5-100724-v16.indd   805-100724-v16.indd   80 11-Jul-24   4:25:05 PM11-Jul-24   4:25:05 PM\\n'),\n",

In the 6th century BCE, a \\nPersian emperor launched a military campaign and gained control of the region of the Indus River , which, as we saw, was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, ‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here to the Hindu religion.) \\nBased on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named \\nthe region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter ‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek language. \\nSindhu Hindhu Indoi / Indike\\nThe ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several texts, they refer to India as ‘Yintu’ or ‘Yindu’. This word also originally comes from ‘Sindhu’, in the following manner:\\nSindhu Hindhu Indu Yindu\\n5-100724-v16.indd   815-100724-v16.indd   81 11-Jul-24   4:25:08 PM11-Jul-24   4:25:08 PM\\n'),\n",
